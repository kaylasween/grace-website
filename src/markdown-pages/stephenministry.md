about: >-
  Stephen Ministry provides one-on-one counseling and caring ministry to members
  of the community who are struggling with a difficult time in their lives, such
  as grief, divorce, job loss or illness. Stephen Ministers are members of the
  congregation that have been trained to provide high quality Christian care to
  people going through tough times. As a Stephen Ministry congregation, we are
  blessed to have a group of people to assist the Pastor in helping others in
  the congregation or community.
